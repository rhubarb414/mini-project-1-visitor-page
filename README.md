Lifted the form/input stuff from the starter code Mark drew up, so I need to spend time actually understanding it. Then it took me forever to figure out why my h1 would cover the nav when I scrolled. It had something to do with the h1 being position: relative, so I need to get sharp on position stuff too. Not even sure why I added a position for it in the first placeâ€¦ shows how much I know right now. :upside_down_face:
